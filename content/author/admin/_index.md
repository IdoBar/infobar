bio: My research interests include application of genomics and bioinformatics tools to improve sustainable production of agriculture crops. These include investigating pathogen populations genetics and genomics, changes in crops gene expression in response to pathogen attack and developing molecular probes for highly accurate pathogen diagnostic devices.

I am a lecturer for Bioinformatics at Griffith University, Nathan campus, developing, teaching and convene academic courses, as well as supervising under- and postgraduate students in research projects.

In addition to lecturing, as a researcher of the Environment Futures Research Institute (EFRI), I investigate the genomics of fungal pathogens in major legume crops to identify ways to overcome diseases and develop resistant crops to help future food security.  
 
Current courses: Introduction to Bioinformatics (3030NSC), Molecular Biology (2012NSC)
